# **Implementation of Page 2 of Report 1: Product Performance**

**Objective:**  
Identify the best-performing products in terms of sales and profitability.  
Analyze the distribution of sales by price range.  
Implement advanced interactivity with **Drillthrough** and **Advanced Tooltips**.

## **Step 1: Visualization of Best-Selling Products**  
**Interactive Table**  
**Displayed Columns:**  
- `DimProduct[ProductLabel]` → Product name  
- `TotalSales` → Total sales amount by product  
- `ProfitMargin` → Profit margin by product  
- `TotalProductsSold` → Total number of units sold  
**Sorting**: Sorted by `TotalSales` (from highest to lowest).

**Adding a Drillthrough**  
**Action**: When a product is selected, the report navigates to a **detailed page** displaying the sales distribution for that specific product.

---

## **Step 2: Sales Distribution by Price Range**  
**Pie Chart**  
**Axes:**  
- **Legend**: `FactSales[PriceCategory]` → Price categories (`Premium`, `Mid-Range`, `Entry-Level`).  
- **Value**: `TotalSales` → Total sales by price range.  

**Interactivity:**  
Select a price range → **Filter products** belonging to that range in the interactive table.

---

## **Step 3: Ranking of Best-Selling Products**  
**Horizontal Bar Chart**  
**Axes:**  
- `Y`: `DimProduct[ProductLabel]` → Product name  
- `X`: `TotalSales` → Total sales amount  
**Sorting**: **Dynamic**, based on sales volume.

**Interactivity:**  
**Drillthrough enabled**: Click on a product to see **sales and returns details**.

---

## **Step 4: Adding Advanced Tooltips**  
**Why?**  
To display **additional information** about a product without overcrowding the display.  
Allows for quick viewing of **profitability and quantity sold** without changing pages.

**Adding a custom Tooltip** on the **Best-Selling Products Chart**  
When the user hovers over a product, they will see:  
- `TotalSales`  
- `ProfitMargin`  
- `TotalProductsSold`

## **Step 5: Adding Slicers for Dynamic Filtering**  
**Slicers added:**  
`DimCategory[CategoryName]` → Select a specific product category.  
`FactSales[PriceCategory]` → Select a price range.

---

## **Step 6: Adding Navigation Buttons**  
**Interactive Buttons:**  
**“Overview” Button** → Return to **Page 1**.  
**“Promotion Impact” Button** → Go to **Page 3**.
