# Report 2 – Page 2: Promotion Effectiveness Over Time**

## 🎯 **Page Objective**  
Help students evaluate how **individual promotions** performed over time in terms of:
- Sales trends
- Discount intensity
- Return rates
- Category breakdowns

They will learn how to use **hierarchies**, **slicers scoped to visuals**, and advanced **time series analysis**.

---

## 🧩 **Visual Layout and Explanation (4 Visuals)**

---

### 🔹 **Visual 1: Line Chart – Sales Trend per Promotion**
**Goal**: Show how each promotion performs monthly.

**How to Build**:
1. X-axis: `DimDate[DateKey]` → enable *Year > Month hierarchy*.
2. Legend: `DimPromotion[PromotionName]`
3. Values: `[Total Sales]`
4. Add **data labels** and smooth the line.
5. Use `Date` hierarchy for **drilldown** across time levels (Year > Quarter > Month).

🧠 **Student Tip**: "Hover over peaks – maybe a promotion caused that spike!"

---

### 🔹 **Visual 2: Clustered Column Chart – Discount Percent by Promotion**
**Goal**: Understand discount strategies behind promotions.

**How to Build**:
1. Axis: `DimPromotion[PromotionName]`
2. Value: `Average DiscountPercent` from `TableProductPromo`
3. Add **constant line** with average discount across all promotions for comparison:
   ```DAX
   Avg Discount All Promotions = AVERAGEX(TableProductPromo, TableProductPromo[DiscountPercent])
   ```

4. Insert it via **Analytics pane → Constant Line**

---

### 🔹 **Visual 3: 100% Stacked Column – Return Rate by Promotion**
**Goal**: Identify promotions that result in higher product returns.

**How to Build**:
1. Axis: `DimPromotion[PromotionName]`
2. Values: `[ReturnRate]`
3. Tooltip: Add `[Total Sales]` and `[NetSales]` for insight

🧠 **Student Tip**: “Sometimes high returns = poor targeting or misleading discounts!”

---

### 🔹 **Visual 4: Matrix – Promotion Performance by Product Category**
**Type**: Matrix  
**Goal**: Detailed view of sales and discount behavior by **category and promotion**

**How to Build**:
1. Rows: `DimCategory[CategoryName]`
2. Columns: `DimPromotion[PromotionName]`
3. Values: `[Total Sales]`, `[NetSales]`, `Average DiscountPercent`
4. Apply **conditional formatting** to highlight high-performing combos.

---

## 🎛️ **Interactivity and UX Enhancements**

- **Slicer: Promotion Name**  
   - Set slicer to affect only Visuals 1 and 3 (use *Edit interactions*).
   - Use `DimPromotion[PromotionName]`

- **Drillthrough Setup**  
   - Allow drillthrough to Report 2 Page 3 on `PromotionName`
   - Pass context like `[Total Sales]`, `[DiscountPercent]`, etc.

- **Hierarchies**: Already present in the `DimDate` table. Encourage **drill down and up** actions.

---

## 🧠 Educational Focus

💡 Encourage students to answer:
- Which promotions drove the most consistent sales?
- Is there a clear correlation between discount size and return rate?
- Which category/promotion pairs worked best?

Shall we proceed to **Report 2 – Page 3**, or would you like to adjust/add something here before continuing?
