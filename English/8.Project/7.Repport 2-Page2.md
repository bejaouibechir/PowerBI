# **Implementation of Page 2 of Report 2: Impact of Seasonality on Sales**

**Objective:**  
Analyze the influence of seasonal periods on sales.  
Compare sales between **high season and low season**.  
Identify the effect of **weekdays vs weekends** on sales.  
Implement advanced interactivity with **Drillthrough, Dynamic Slicers, and Temporal Comparisons**.

## **Step 1: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
**Adding KPI Cards to display seasonal metrics**  
**KPI 1: High Season Sales**  
```DAX
HighSeasonSales = 
SUMX(
    FILTER(FactSales, FactSales[HighSeason] = "Haute Saison"), 
    FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice]
)
```
**KPI 2: Low Season Sales**  
```DAX
LowSeasonSales = 
SUMX(
    FILTER(FactSales, FactSales[HighSeason] = "Basse Saison"), 
    FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice]
)
```
**KPI 3: High vs Low Season Comparison (%)**  
```DAX
SeasonalImpact = 
DIVIDE([HighSeasonSales], [LowSeasonSales], 0)
```

**Visuals:**  
- **KPI Card for `HighSeasonSales`** (monetary).  
- **KPI Card for `LowSeasonSales`** (monetary).  
- **KPI Card for `SeasonalImpact`** (percentage difference between high and low season).  

---

## **Step 2: Sales Analysis by Season**  
**Stacked Bar Chart**  
**Axes:**  
- **X**: `DimDate[YYYYMM]` (Month).  
- **Y**: `HighSeasonSales` and `LowSeasonSales`.  

**Interactivity:**  
**Drillthrough enabled**: Clicking on a month allows access to detailed seasonal sales data for that month.

---

## **Step 3: Weekdays vs Weekends Sales Analysis**  
**Comparative Line Chart**  
**Axes:**  
- **X**: `DimDate[YYYYMM]` (Month).  
- **Y (Line 1)**: Total sales on weekdays (`SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice])` with `DayCategory = "Jour Ouvrable"`).  
- **Y (Line 2)**: Total sales on weekends (`SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice])` with `DayCategory = "Week-end"`).  

**Interactivity:**  
**Advanced tooltips** to view sales details for a specific day.  
**Drillthrough** to access **details of the best-selling products** on weekdays or weekends.

---

## **Step 4: Seasonal Performance Table**  
**Interactive Table**  
**Columns displayed:**  
- `DimDate[YYYYMM]` → Month.  
- `HighSeasonSales` → High season sales.  
- `LowSeasonSales` → Low season sales.  
- `SeasonalImpact` → Percentage difference.  

**Dynamic sorting** on `SeasonalImpact` to view periods with the greatest seasonal impact.

---

## **Step 5: Adding Slicers for Dynamic Exploration**  
**Slicers added:**  
`DimDate[YYYYMM]` → Select a specific period.  
`FactSales[HighSeason]` → Select High or Low season.  
`FactSales[DayCategory]` → Filter by **weekday or weekend**.

---

## **Step 6: Adding Buttons for Intuitive Navigation**  
**Interactive Buttons:**  
**"Season Details" Button** → Drillthrough to a **detailed page** showing product performance by season.  
**"Return to Channel Performance" Button** → Return to **Page 1 of Report 2**.  
**"Product Return Analysis" Button** → Go to **Page 3 of Report 2**.
