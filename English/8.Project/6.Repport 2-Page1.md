# **Report 2 – Page 1: Product Category and Promotion Deep Dive**  

## 🎯 **Page Objective**  
Allow users to:
- Compare performance **between product categories**
- Analyze **promotion usage** and **efficiency**
- Use **grouping, drillthrough, and slicers** to dig deeper into category-wise sales

---

## 🧩 **Visual Layout and Explanation (4 visuals)**

---

### 🔹 **Visual 1: KPI Cards by Product Category**
**Type**: Multi-row card  
**Based On**: `DimCategory`, `Total Sales`, `NetSales`, `ReturnRate`  

**How to Build**:
1. Drag a *Multi-row Card* visual.
2. Add the following **measures**, filtered by each `CategoryName`:
   - `Total Sales`
   - `NetSales`
   - `ReturnRate`
3. Add **CategoryName** from `DimCategory` to the **Category filter pane (Visual-level filter)**.
4. Style each card with data bars or color based on threshold (conditional formatting).

### 🔹 **Visual 2: Stacked Column Chart – Sales by Category and Promotion**
**Goal**: Compare how each **promotion type** performs **within each product category**.

**How to Build**:
1. Use the `TableProductPromo` table (already calculated).
2. X-Axis: `Category`
3. Legend: `Promotion`
4. Values: `Total Sales` (calculated from `FactSales`)
5. Add a **constant line** using `MAX Total Sales By Promotion` to compare visually.

To create the constant line showing the maximum of total sales by promotion, here’s the DAX measure formula you should use:
``` DAX
MAX Total Sales By Promotion = 
MAXX(
    VALUES(DimPromotion[PromotionName]),
    CALCULATE([Total Sales])
)
```

### 🔹 **Visual 3: TreeMap – Revenue Contribution by Category**
**Type**: TreeMap  
**Based On**: `DimCategory[CategoryName]`, `Total Sales`  

**How to Build**:
1. Use `CategoryName` as the **Group**.
2. Use `[Total Sales]` as **Values**.
3. Tooltips can show:
   - `NetSales`
   - `ReturnRate`
   - `ChannelPerformanceIndex` (optional)

> This is great for visually identifying the **most revenue-contributing categories**.

---

### 🔹 **Visual 4: Line and Clustered Column Chart – Promotions by Category Over Time**
**Type**: Line and Clustered Column  
**Goal**: Compare **category sales over time**, showing **promotion overlap**.

**How to Build**:
1. Shared Axis: `DimDate[Year]` 
2. Column Values: `Total Sales` per category
3. Line Values: Add average `DiscountPercent` (from `TableProductPromo`)

> This shows how promotions align with peaks/dips in sales by category.

## 🎛️ **Interactivity and UX Enhancements**

- **Slicer (Affects Only Visuals 1 & 2)**  
   - Field: `DimCategory[CategoryName]`  
   - In the format pane, under “Edit interactions” → Turn OFF interaction with **Visual 3 and 4**.

- **Drillthrough Setup (to Page 2 or 3)**  
   - Enable drillthrough on **category field**  
   - Use fields from `DimCategory`, `TableProductPromo`, and `FactSales`

- **Tooltips**: Add `[ProfitMargin in %]` and `DiscountCategory` to help interpret results faster
