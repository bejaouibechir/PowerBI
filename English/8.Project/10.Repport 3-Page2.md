# **Implementation of Page 2 of Report 3: User Experience and Navigation**

**Objective:**  
Optimize **navigation** to facilitate report exploration.  
Make the **user experience smoother and more interactive** using **dynamic buttons, slicers, and advanced tooltips**.  
Enhance the **ergonomics and accessibility** of the report with well-organized visual elements.

## **Step 1: Adding Dynamic Slicers**  
**Why?**  
Allows users to **quickly filter data** without changing pages.  
Improves **navigation experience** by displaying relevant data based on user selection.  

**Slicers to Integrate:**  
`DimDate[YYYYMM]` → Select a specific period.  
`DimCategory[CategoryName]` → Filter data by product category.  
`DimChannel[ChannelName]` → Select a sales channel.  

**Interactivity:**  
**When the user selects a value, all reports and pages update automatically.**

## **Step 2: Interactive Buttons for Smooth Navigation**  
**Why?**  
**Facilitates navigation** between different sections of the report.  
Allows users to **quickly jump from one report to another** without using the standard Power BI tabs.  

**Buttons to Integrate:**  
**"Financial Overview" Button** → Return to **Page 1 (Financial Overview)**.  
**"Final Dashboard" Button** → Go to **Page 3 (Summary Dashboard)**.  
**"Back to Global Sales" Button** → Go to **Report 1 (Sales and Product Analysis)**.  
**"Channel and Seasonality Report" Button** → Go to **Report 2 (Channel Distribution and Seasonality Analysis)**.  

**Button Customization:**  
**Add Icons** (arrows, charts, reports).  
**Dynamic Animations and Colors** to enhance visibility.  
**Transparent Buttons** placed over specific areas to make navigation more intuitive.

## **Step 3: Advanced Tooltips for More Information**  
**Why?**  
Avoids overloading the screen with too much information by displaying **details on hover** of an element.  

**Where to Apply Tooltips?**  
**On navigation buttons** → Explain the page the user will be redirected to.  
**On slicers** → Display data filtered based on the selection.  
**On financial KPIs** → Explain the calculation and trend (increase/decrease).  

**Example of Tooltip on a KPI:**  
Hovering over **profit margin** displays:  
- **Current Profit Margin (%)**  
- **Profit Margin from Previous Month (%)**  
- **Change (%)**

## **Step 4: Customizing the Interface and Ergonomics**  
**Why?**  
A **clean and structured design** improves **user engagement** and makes data easier to read.  
Provides a **more attractive and understandable report**.  

**UX Enhancements Applied:**  
**Use of Shapes and Containers** → Group KPIs and slicers coherently.  
**Optimized Alignment and Spacing** → Avoid visual overload.  
**Use of Themes and Color Palettes** → Make the report more readable and modern.  
**Adding Visual Separators** between sections for clarity.

## **Step 5: Testing and Verifying Interactivity**  
**Why?**  
Ensure that **navigation is smooth** and that all interactive elements are working correctly.  

**Tests to Perform:**  
Verify that **navigation buttons correctly redirect** to the right pages.  
Test **slicers** and check if **visuals update instantly**.  
Verify that **tooltips display properly** and provide relevant information.
