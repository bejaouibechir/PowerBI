# **Implementation of Page 1 of Report 2: Performance of Sales Channels**

**Objective:**  
Analyze the distribution of sales by distribution channels.  
Identify the most performing channels in terms of sales volume and profitability.  
Implement advanced interactivity with **Drillthrough**, **Slicers**, and **Dynamic Ranking of Channels**.

## **Step 1: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
**Adding KPI Cards to display main metrics**  
**KPI 1: Total Sales by Channel**  
```DAX
TotalSalesByChannel = 
SUMX(
    FactSales, 
    FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice]
)
```
**KPI 2: Profit Margin by Channel (%)**  
```DAX
ProfitMarginByChannel = 
DIVIDE(
    SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice]) - SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice] * 0.6), 
    SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice]),
    0
)
```
**KPI 3: Channel Performance (Dynamic Ranking)**  
```DAX
ChannelPerformanceIndex = 
RANKX(ALL(DimChannel), [TotalSalesByChannel], , DESC, DENSE)
```

**Visuals:**  
- **KPI Card for `TotalSalesByChannel`** (monetary).  
- **KPI Card for `ProfitMarginByChannel`** (percentage).  
- **KPI Card for `ChannelPerformanceIndex`** (ranking).

## **Step 2: Sales Distribution by Channel**  
**Stacked Bar Chart**  
**Axes:**  
- **X**: `DimChannel[ChannelName]` (Channel name).  
- **Y**: `TotalSalesByChannel` (Total sales amount).  

**Interactivity:**  
**Drillthrough enabled**: Selecting a channel will take you to the details of the products sold through that channel.

---

## **Step 3: Analysis of Each Channel's Contribution to Total Sales**  
**Pie Chart**  
**Axes:**  
- **Legend**: `DimChannel[ChannelName]` (Channel name).  
- **Value**: `TotalSalesByChannel` (Total sales amount).  

**Interactivity:**  
Selecting a channel **dynamically updates** the other visuals on the page.

---

## **Step 4: Dynamic Analysis of Channel Performance**  
**Interactive Table**  
**Columns displayed:**  
- `DimChannel[ChannelName]` → Channel name.  
- `TotalSalesByChannel` → Total sales amount.  
- `ProfitMarginByChannel` → Profit margin.  
- `ChannelPerformanceIndex` → Channel ranking.  

**Dynamic sorting** on `TotalSalesByChannel` to show the highest-performing channels first.

## **Step 5: Adding Slicers for Dynamic Exploration**  
**Slicers added:**  
`DimDate[YYYYMM]` → Select a specific period.  
`DimChannel[ChannelName]` → Select a specific channel.

---

## **Step 6: Adding Buttons for Intuitive Navigation**  
**Interactive Buttons:**  
**"Channel Details" Button** → Drillthrough to a **detailed page** showing the best-selling products by channel.  
**"Seasonality Impact" Button** → Go to **Page 2 of Report 2**.  
**"Return to Global Sales" Button** → Return to **Report 1**.
