# **Creating Calculated Columns and DAX Measures**  

**Objective:**  
- Add **calculated columns** to enrich analysis and facilitate data exploitation in reports.  
- Create **advanced, optimized, and corrected DAX measures** to generate relevant KPIs.  

---

## **2.1. Calculated Columns**  

**Why these calculated columns?**  
- They enrich tables with **derived** information, making analysis easier.  
- They allow adding **classifications and useful groupings** for reports.  

---

### **1. Promotion Category (DimPromotion)**  
**Explanation:** This column classifies promotions based on the applied discount percentage.  
```DAX
DiscountCategory =
SWITCH(TRUE(),
    DimPromotion[DiscountPercent] >= 50, "Very High",
    DimPromotion[DiscountPercent] >= 30, "High",
    DimPromotion[DiscountPercent] >= 10, "Moderate",
    "Low"
)
```
**Usage:** Allows analyzing the impact of promotions by category in visuals.  

---

### **2. Product Classification by Price Range (FactSales)**  
**Correction:** Replaced `DimProduct[StandardCost]` with `FactSales[UnitPrice]`, which is an actual data point in the model.  
**Explanation:** Categorizes products into three price categories based on their selling price.  
```DAX
PriceCategory =
IF(FactSales[UnitPrice] > 400, "Premium",
    IF(FactSales[UnitPrice] > 200, "Mid-Range", "Entry-Level")
)
```
**Usage:** Enables analyzing sales trends by price segment.  

---

### **3. Product Stock Status (FactSales)**  
**Explanation:** Indicates whether a product is still available in stock or out of stock.  
```DAX
ProductStatus =
IF(FactSales[SalesQuantity] > 0, "In Stock", "Out of Stock")
```
**Usage:** Can be used in **pivot tables and interactive filters**.  

---

### **4. Number of Promotions Applied (FactSales)**  
**Explanation:** Identifies whether a sale benefited from a promotion or not.  
```DAX
PromotionApplied =
IF(ISBLANK(FactSales[PromotionKey]), "No", "Yes")
```
**Usage:** Helps evaluate the impact of promotions on sales.  

---

### **5. Sales Day Classification (DimDate)**  
**Correction:** Since `DateKey` is stored in **YYYYMMDD** format, the date must be extracted correctly before applying `WEEKDAY()`.  
**Explanation:** Categorizes days as **Weekend** or **Workday**.  
```DAX
DayCategory =
VAR CorrectDate =
    DATE(
        LEFT(DimDate[DateKey], 4),
        MID(DimDate[DateKey], 5, 2),
        RIGHT(DimDate[DateKey], 2)
    )
RETURN
SWITCH(TRUE(),
    WEEKDAY(CorrectDate, 2) >= 6, "Weekend",
    "Workday"
)
```
**Usage:** Filtering and analyzing sales performance on workdays vs. weekends.  

---

### **6. High Season Indicator (FactSales)**  
**Correction:** Correctly extracting the month before applying `MONTH()`.  
**Explanation:** This column identifies whether a sale was made during a high-activity period (e.g., year-end, sales, special promotions).  
```DAX
HighSeason =
VAR CorrectDate =
    DATE(
        LEFT(FactSales[DateKey], 4),
        MID(FactSales[DateKey], 5, 2),
        RIGHT(FactSales[DateKey], 2)
    )
RETURN
IF(
    MONTH(CorrectDate) IN {11, 12, 6, 7},
    "High Season",
    "Low Season"
)
```
**Usage:** Analyzing sales performance during high vs. low seasons.  

---

### **7. Discount Level Evaluation (FactSales)**  
**Explanation:** Categorizes transactions based on the applied discount amount.  
```DAX
DiscountLevel =
SWITCH(TRUE(),
    FactSales[DiscountAmount] = 0, "No Discount",
    FactSales[DiscountAmount] < 50, "Low Discount",
    FactSales[DiscountAmount] < 200, "Medium Discount",
    "High Discount"
)
```
**Usage:** Helps analyze the effect of promotions on sales volumes and margins.  

---

## **2.2. DAX Measures**  

**Why use measures?**  
- They enable **dynamic calculations based on the visuals used**.  
- They optimize performance by avoiding storing fixed values.  

---

### **1. Total Sales (FactSales)**  
```DAX
TotalSales = SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice])
```
**A key indicator for all sales reports.**  

---

### **2. Total Cost of Sold Products (FactSales)**  
```DAX
TotalCost = SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice] * 0.6)
```
**Helps assess profitability by comparing it to total sales.**  

---

### **3. Profit Margin (FactSales)**  
```DAX
ProfitMargin = DIVIDE(([TotalSales] - [TotalCost]), [TotalSales], 0)
```
### **4.Average Discount Rate** 
```DAX
Average Discount Rate = SUM(FactSales[DiscountAmount]) / SUM(FactSales[UnitPrice]*FactSales[SalesQuantity])
```
