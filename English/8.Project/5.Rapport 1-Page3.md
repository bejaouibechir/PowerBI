# **Implementation of Page 3 of Report 1: Impact of Promotions on Sales**

**Objective:**  
Analyze the impact of promotions on sales and profitability.  
Compare sales with and without promotions.  
Identify the products most influenced by promotions.  
Implement advanced techniques such as **Grouping**, **Drillthrough**, and **Dynamic Filters**.

---

## **Step 1: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
**Adding KPI Cards to display main metrics**  
**KPI 1: Total sales generated with promotions**  
```DAX
SalesWithPromo = 
SUMX(
    FILTER(FactSales, FactSales[PromotionApplied] = "Yes"), 
    FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice]
)
```
**KPI 2: Promotion sales rate (%)**  
```DAX
PromoSalesRate = 
DIVIDE([SalesWithPromo], [TotalSales], 0)
```
**KPI 3: Impact of promotions on revenue**  
```DAX
PromotionImpact = 
DIVIDE(
    SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice] - FactSales[DiscountAmount]),
    [TotalSales],
    0
)
```

**Visuals:**  
- **KPI Card for `SalesWithPromo`** (monetary)  
- **KPI Card for `PromoSalesRate`** (percentage)  
- **KPI Card for `PromotionImpact`** (profitability indicator)

## **Step 2: Comparison of Sales with and without Promotion**  
**Combined Chart (Bars + Line)**  
**Axes:**  
- **X**: `DimDate[YYYYMM]` (Month)  
- **Y (Bars)**: Sales with promotions (`SalesWithPromo`)  
- **Y (Line)**: Sales without promotions (`TotalSales - SalesWithPromo`)

**Interactivity:**  
Adding a **Drillthrough** → Clicking on a month allows access to the **best-selling products with promotion for that month**.

---

## **Step 3: Products Most Influenced by Promotions**  
**Stacked Bar Chart**  
**Axes:**  
- **X**: `DimProduct[ProductLabel]` (Product name)  
- **Y**: `SalesWithPromo` and `TotalSales - SalesWithPromo`

**Grouping Products**  
**Group products** into 3 segments:  
- **Products strongly influenced by promotions** (`SalesWithPromo > 60% of TotalSales`)  
- **Moderately influenced products** (`SalesWithPromo between 30% and 60%`)  
- **Weakly influenced products** (`SalesWithPromo < 30%`)

---

## **Step 4: Drillthrough to Promotion Details**  
**Creating a "Promotion Detail" Drillthrough page**  
**Information displayed:**  
- Details of products benefiting from the selected promotion  
- Discount rate  
- Sales before and after the promotion  

**How to activate it?**  
- Select a promotion → **Drillthrough** → Promotion details

---

## **Step 5: Adding Slicers for Dynamic Exploration**  
**Slicers added:**  
`DimPromotion[PromotionLabel]` → Select a specific promotion.  
`DimDate[YYYYMM]` → Select a specific period.

---

## **Step 6: Adding Buttons for Intuitive Navigation**  
**Interactive Buttons:**  
**“Back to Overview” Button** → Return to **Page 1**.  
**“Product Performance” Button** → Go to **Page 2**.  
**“Promotion Details” Button** → Go to the **Drillthrough page**.
