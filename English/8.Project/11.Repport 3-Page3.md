# **Implementation of Page 3 of Report 3: Summary Dashboard**

**Objective:**  
Consolidate all data into a **global dashboard** providing a synthetic view of business performance.  
Present **key indicators in one place** for easier interpretation.  
Integrate **interactive charts, dynamic slicers, and navigation buttons** to enhance the user experience.

## **Step 1: Displaying Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
**Why?**  
Provides an **overview of performance** at a glance.  
Facilitates comparison of **results across different periods and channels**.  

**KPIs Displayed:**  
**Total Revenue (Sales Amount)**  
```DAX
TotalRevenue = SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice])
```
**Total Cost of Goods Sold**  
```DAX
TotalCost = SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice] * 0.6)
```
**Profit Margin (%)**  
```DAX
ProfitMargin = DIVIDE(([TotalRevenue] - [TotalCost]), [TotalRevenue], 0)
```
**Return Rate (%)**  
```DAX
ReturnRate = DIVIDE(SUM(FactSales[ReturnQuantity]), SUM(FactSales[SalesQuantity]), 0)
```
**Promotion Impact on Revenue (%)**  
```DAX
PromoRevenueImpact = 
DIVIDE(
    SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[SalesQuantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice] - FactSales[DiscountAmount]),
    [TotalRevenue],
    0
)
```

**Visuals:**  
**KPI Cards** for each indicator.  
**Trend displays** with icons (increase/decrease in performance).  
**Advanced tooltips** to show value changes compared to the previous year.

## **Step 2: Dynamic Product Performance Table**
**Why?**  
Allows viewing **product performance in terms of sales, margins, and returns**.  
Uses **dynamic sorting** to display top-performing products at the top.  

**Columns Displayed:**  
`DimProduct[ProductLabel]` → Product name.  
`TotalRevenue` → Total sales amount.  
`ProfitMargin` → Profit margin %.  
`ReturnRate` → Product return rate.  
`PromoRevenueImpact` → Impact of promotions on product sales.  

**Interactivity:**  
**Slicer** to filter products by category and channel.  
**Drillthrough activated** to view **detailed sales and return data** for a selected product.

## **Step 3: Combined Chart: Consolidated Performance View**
**Why?**  
Allows comparison of **sales and profitability trends over time**.  
Superimposes trends to better visualize correlations.  

**Axes:**  
**X**: `DimDate[YYYYMM]` (Month).  
**Y (Bars)**: `TotalRevenue` (Total Sales).  
**Y (Line)**: `ProfitMargin` (Profit Margin %).  

**Interactivity:**  
**Selecting a period updates all other visuals.**  
**Filtering by category and channel** for a more precise analysis.

---

## **Step 4: Channel Performance Analysis**
**Stacked Bar Chart**  
**Axes:**  
- **X**: `DimChannel[ChannelName]` (Channel Name).  
- **Y**: `TotalRevenue` (Sales by Channel).  

**Interactivity:**  
**Drillthrough enabled** to see **top-selling products by channel**.

---

## **Step 5: Adding Slicers for Dynamic Exploration**
**Why?**  
Allows users to **filter data without changing pages**.  
Helps **refine the analysis by selecting only relevant data**.  

**Slicers Integrated:**  
`DimDate[YYYYMM]` → Select a specific period.  
`DimCategory[CategoryName]` → Select a product category.  
`DimChannel[ChannelName]` → Select a sales channel.  

**Interactivity:**  
**All dashboard elements update automatically** based on the user's selection.

## **Step 6: Adding Buttons for Intuitive Navigation**
**Why?**  
Facilitates returning to **detailed reports** for deeper analysis.  
Provides a **smooth experience** without needing to use Power BI tabs.  

**Buttons to Integrate:**  
**"Financial Overview" Button** → Return to **Page 1 of Report 3**.  
**"User Experience" Button** → Return to **Page 2 of Report 3**.  
**"Sales and Products Report" Button** → Go to **Report 1**.  
**"Channel and Seasonality Report" Button** → Go to **Report 2**.  

**Customization:**  
**Add visual icons** to enhance the user experience.  
**Tooltips on buttons** to explain where they lead.

**Consolidated KPIs**: Revenue, Cost, Margin, Returns, Promotion Impact.  
**Dynamic Performance Table** for products.  
**Combined Chart (Bars + Line)** to track sales and margins.  
**Stacked Bar Chart** to compare channel performance.  
**Slicers for dynamic data filtering**.  
**Interactive buttons** for smooth navigation.
